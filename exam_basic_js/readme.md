## Exam - Basic JavaScript
Here in the tests section you'll find a couple of files of prepared exam topics/questions.
Your task is:
1. Clone this repo locally
2. Create a branch named: `exam-basic-js/<your name here>`
3. Provide answers to the exams in the section "Work area"
4. Please commit your branches and push when done

During the exam, feel free to utalize your Google skills as well, no restrictions here. Please also timebox yourself for up to 15 minutes per task/file.

Also please don't forget to share your screens and be mindful of other folks around you on meeting. Don't make loud noises, programmers are easily jump-scared.
